### Description:  
This study examines TripAdvisor travelers’ ratings within a range of different categories of attractions throughout East Asia and aims to provide insight for customized travel itineraries and potential travel social groups. These data come from the travel and tourism domain and can help provide planning support for tour companies and travel marketing.  

To analyze the data, I explored the relationships between ratings by category and across all users with visualizations in Python, R, and Tableau. Through machine learning analysis, specifically clustering, I was able to group users into three clusters based on shared preferences.
