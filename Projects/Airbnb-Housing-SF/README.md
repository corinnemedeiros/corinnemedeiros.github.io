# Airbnb’s Impact on Housing in San Francisco 

![SF Painted Ladies](sf.jpg)

### Description:  
This project explores Airbnb and housing trends in San Francisco, California from 2015 to 2020.  Historically, there has been controversy among communities surrounding the rise in Airbnb properties and how that affects housing prices. Yet data from the last 6 years suggest that there is no direct link between inflated real estate prices and Airbnb’s growth. Analyzing these data helps communities understand the factors contributing to changes around them while also ensuring less negativity towards Airbnb.
