### Description:  

This study examines tweets related to new sports included in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and aims to provide insight for customized marketing plans, scheduling, and potential sponsorships. The domain these data come from is the sports industry, with a focus on social media. Six debut sports, along with additional new events for existing sports, have been added to the Tokyo Olympics schedule including surfing, skateboarding, climbing, karate, and more (Smith, 2021). Fans on Twitter express their feelings towards these new events, providing important insight for the International Olympic Committee and sports sponsors through sentiment analysis.  

To analyze the data, I used Python to filter tweets by a selection of new sports, create exploratory visualizations for understanding patterns, and process subsets of the data to prepare for text analysis. Then, I analyzed the sentiment of the relevant tweets and produced supporting visualizations to illustrate the trends.
