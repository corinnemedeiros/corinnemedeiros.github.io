### Description:  
This project focuses on groups of endangered and threatened species including mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, with some initial exploration of harvest data by region. My hypothesis explores the relationship between time and endangered or threatened status, as well as relationships between specific groups of species and all species together. The dataset comes from the U.S. Department of Agricultureâ€™s website, provided by the Forest Service Research & Development (FS R&D) on wildlife population and harvest data. It includes data captured from 1955 until 2010. The data extend across a range of assessment areas, including the Pacific Coast, Rocky Mountain, North, and South.
