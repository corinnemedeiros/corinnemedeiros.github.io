### Description:  

The objective of this study is to predict which “hotel cluster” a user is likely to book within the Expedia Hotel Recommendations data, given the user's search details. After previewing and summarizing the data, I generate exploratory visualizations and calculate correlation. For predictive models, I use a Random Forest Classifier and then a Naive Bayes Classifier to predict hotel groups.
