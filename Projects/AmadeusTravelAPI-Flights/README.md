### Description:  

I'm interested in visiting Los Angeles this summer on July 9th. I'm pulling data from the Amadeus Travel API (https://developers.amadeus.com/) to see what my flight options are. This program pulls the flight data, stores it in a Pandas dataframe, cleans up headers and columns, and saves the dataframe to a CSV file.
